						<span id="pastor_lee">Lee grew up in Tucson, Arizona. He became a Christian at Vacation Bible School, was called to ministry at a summer youth camp and studied at Pacific Coast Baptist. Lee spent ten years in ministry at a church in West Texas before becoming the pastor at SeaCoast in 1989. He loves teaching and preaching the scriptures and shepherding the church here. He is married to his beautiful wife, Janice, and they have two daughters and three grandchildren. He loves being a grandparent - and would have had the grandchildren first if allowed. He is a huge baseball fan - an LA Angels lifer.</span>

						<span id="pastor_josh">Coming from a Cinema-Television background, Josh took the road less travelled to become a youth pastor. Over the past 13 years he has brought those skills & techniques into messages, media & programs designed to get youth & college/career aged individuals excited for Christ. As creative & &#39;outside the box&#39; as he can get, Josh makes sure to keep his students&#39; relationship with Christ as the number one focus. Josh also does a good amount of sketch writing & multi-media editing for SeaCoast worship services & special events. When Josh isn&#39;t challenging youth with fun, hard-hitting scriptural truths or waiting for his edits to render, you can find him watching hockey, playing Xbox One games, pinball machines and hanging out with his wife, Erin.</span>
