			<h3>A&O College and Career - Ages 18 to 30</h3>
			<h4 class="time">Thursday 7 PM</h4>

		<p>A&O College and Career provides an encouraging, relaxed environment for 18-30 year olds to come together, drink coffee, nibble on snacks, support one another, and learn about God&#39;s Word and His plan for their lives. There&#39;s plenty of fun and fellowship, and you&#39;re almost guaranteed to read or discuss something life-changing every week. Whether you&#39;re a long-time Christian, or just now exploring issues of faith, A&O is equally effective and enjoyable!</p>

			<h3>The Underground - High School</h3>
			<h4 class="time">Sunday 6-8 PM</h4>
		</div>
		<p>Meeting in SeaCoast&#39;s youth facility, &#39;The Cellar&#39;, The Underground is meant to solidify high schoolers&#39; relationship with Christ. While there is plenty of fun in the form of crazy games, fun events, and once-in-a-lifetime trips, members of The Underground can expect to be personally challenged to live out their faith, examine the scriptures and discover the true meaning of &#39;worship&#39;. We don&#39;t shy away from tough questions. Our format switches between units of Small Group discussion and study for several weeks to units of messages for several weeks. The Underground is open to all 9th - 12th graders.</p>
