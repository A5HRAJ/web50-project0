			<h3>Guy Waters&#39; Life and Theology of Paul</h3>
			<h4 class="time">Thursday at 1 PM</h4>
		</div>
		<p>Before being beaten and imprisoned, planting multiple churches, and authoring much of the New Testament, Paul had no equal as a Pharisee in his dedication to the law and his persecution of the early church-but God called Paul to be an Apostle. Join Dr. Guy Waters in this new 12-part series as he identifies key moments in Paul&#39;s life and considers the essence of Paul&#39;s God-centered theology. Paul&#39;s inspired writings and the story of his life continue to be a precious gift to the church, used by God to encourage and equip His people in every generation.</p>
